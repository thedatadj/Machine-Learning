# Breast Cancer Diagnosis with Machine Learning
In this project I used a machine learning model to accurately diagnose breast cancer. Using the renowned Breast Cancer Winconsin Database, I created a classifier capable of distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors.


## What I learned.
* I learned to use KNN classifier.
* I learned to train, predict and evaluate a machine learning model.
* I learned to explored and prepared the data.
